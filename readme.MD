# Stability of Submoons

In this code, we numerically integrate the equations of motions governing the tidal dynamics in a 'four-nested-bodies system', that is to say a submoon system: A submoon orbiting a moon, orbiting a planet, orbiting a star.

These are six ordinary, first-order, non-linear differential equations (quantities exponentiated to a non-trivial power and signum function).
